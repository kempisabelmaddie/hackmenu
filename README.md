It is a voice-controlled menu page.

## Talk box

You can speak what you want the webpage to do as follows:

- Navigating between pages: "[pagename] page"

Note that you must order multiple instances of the same item separately.
- Checkout: "[method]"
Note that if multiple types of payment are detected, it will ask for confirmation for which one.
